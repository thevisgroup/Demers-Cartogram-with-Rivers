  abstract = {Cartograms are used to visualize geographically distributed data by scaling the regions of a map (e.g., US states) such that their areas are proportional to some data associated with them (e.g., population). Thus the cartogram computation problem can be considered as a map deformation problem where the input is a planar polygonal map M and an assignment of some positive weight for each region. The goal is to create a deformed map M , where the area of each region realizes the weight assigned to it (no cartographic error) while the overall map remains readable and recognizable (e.g., the topology, relative positions and shapes of the regions remain as close to those before the deformation as possible). Although several such measures of cartogram quality are well-known, different cartogram generation methods optimize different features and there is no standard set of quantitative metrics. In this paper we define such a set of seven quantitative measures, designed to evaluate how faithfully a cartogram represents the desired weights and to estimate the readability of the final representation. We then study several cartogram-generation algorithms and compare them in terms of these quantitative measures.},

  abstract = {Relative accessibility is a widely studied approach that recognizes access to major locations as subjective and shaped by individual circumstances (e.g., individual preferences, habits, and cultural norms). One missing element in the knowledge base is how relative accessibility can be effectively mapped for decision-making. To fill the research gap, this paper evaluates whether cartograms are an appropriate tool for mapping relative accessibility, taking the city of Zaragoza, Spain as a case study. The research design included three phases: (i) elaboration of grid-based maps on relative non-motorized accessibility; (ii) elaboration of cartograms on relative non-motorized accessibility; (iii) an end-user evaluation with 30 local practitioners to analyze the effectiveness of cartograms to map relative accessibility compared to grid-based maps. Participants signaled that diffusion-based cartograms could be complementary to grid-based maps, providing better visualization of spatial dissimilarity patterns of accessibility between population groups. However, participants noted greater difficulty in identifying Dorling cartograms as an effective technique for mapping relative accessibility. The paper closes with a review of the strengths and weaknesses of the potential application of these visualization techniques in the field of accessibility planning.},

On datasets of such scale, classical graph drawing methods do not take advantage of some human cognitive skills such as shape recognition, which easily remember the global structure of the data. In this paper, we propose a method based on a geographic map metaphor. By employing human perception mechanisms developed by handling geographic maps, this technique facilitates the visualization and navigation through a hierarchy. The algorithm has been designed to preserve regions containment according to the arborescent hierarchy and to set the leaves' sizes proportionally to a property, in such way the size of non-leaf regions correspond to the sum of the sizes of their children. Moreover, the input ordering of the hierarchy's nodes is preserved, i.e. the areas representing two consecutive children of a node in the hierarchy are adjacent. This property is particularly useful as it guarantees some stability to our algorithm. We illustrate our technique by providing example visualizations of the repartition of the tax money in the U.S. over time. Furthermore, we validated the use of the geographical metaphor in a professional documentation context. We show the stability and the ease of memorisation of this type of map.},

Mosaic cartograms communicate well data that consist of, or can be cast into, small integer units (for example, electorial college votes). In addition, they allow users to accurately compare regions and can often maintain a (schematized) version of the input regions' shapes. We propose the first fully automated method to construct mosaic cartograms. To do so, we first introduce mosaic drawings of triangulated planar graphs. We then show how to modify mosaic drawings into mosaic cartograms with low cartographic error while maintaining correct adjacencies between regions. We validate our approach experimentally and compare to other cartogram methods.},

In standard solutions the structure of the visualization is fixed, we explore how to give the user more freedom to define visualizations. Our new approach is based on the usage of Flexible Linked Axes: The user is enabled to define a visualization by drawing and linking axes on a canvas. Each axis has an associated attribute and range, which can be adapted. Links between pairs of axes are used to show data in either scatterplot- or Parallel Coordinates Plot-style. Flexible Linked Axes enable users to define a wide variety of different visualizations. These include standard methods, such as scatterplot matrices, radar charts, and PCPs [11]; less well known approaches, such as Hyperboxes [1], TimeWheels [17], and many-to-many relational parallel coordinate displays [14]; and also custom visualizations, consisting of combinations of scatterplots and PCPs. Furthermore, our method allows users to define composite visualizations that automatically support brushing and linking. We have discussed our approach with ten prospective users, who found the concept easy to understand and highly promising.},

Towards fighting the COVID-19 outbreak, countries worldwide and international organisations have taken various actions, including promoting the transparency of and public access to disease data. In such public communications, maps have played an important role in that a map is worth a thousand words. Most of these have taken the form of a choropleth map. Here, we propose employing cartograms to visualise both the expansion and spread of COVID-19. We designed a combination of six circular cartograms containing the data of confirmed cases every 48 hours from 24 January to 3 February 2020. Such a design conveys both spatial and temporal information more intuitively and efficiently, so it can be expected to facilitate better public participation in the fight against COVID-19.},

Such maps are invaluable for the representation of census results, election returns, disease incidence, and many other kinds of human data. Unfortunately, to scale regions and still have them fit together, one is normally forced to distort the regions' shapes, potentially resulting in maps that are difficult to read. Many methods for making cartograms have been proposed, some of them are extremely complex, but all suffer either from this lack of readability or from other pathologies, like overlapping regions or strong dependence on the choice of coordinate axes. Here, we present a technique based on ideas borrowed from elementary physics that suffers none of these drawbacks. Our method is conceptually simple and produces useful, elegant, and easily readable maps. We illustrate the method with applications to the results of the 2000 U.S. presidential election, lung cancer cases in the State of New York, and the geographical distribution of stories appearing in the news.},

  abstract = {An area cartogram is a transformed map on which areas of regions are proportional to statistical data values; it is considered to be a powerful tool for the visual representation of statistical data. A circle cartogram is a type of area cartograms, on which regions are represented by circles. Its first construction algorithm is proposed by Dorling in 1996, based on the following requirements to construct visually elegant cartograms: 1) maintain the similarity of configurations between circles and regions, 2) express the contiguity of regions on cartograms if possible, and 3) avoid overlap of circles. The algorithm is widely used for its easiness to use and its ability to express a spatial distribution of data; however, the relative positions of circles on cartograms sometimes greatly differ from the geographical maps, since the algorithm does not consider the first requirements explicitly. In this paper, it is first pointed out that the construction problem of circle cartograms resembles that of distance cartograms, and the only difference is the existence of third requirement. Then a new construction method for circle cartograms is proposed based on the distance cartogram construction method; the proposed method is formulated as non-linear minimization with inequality constraint conditions. Finally its applicability is confirmed using dataset, including the comparison with the result of previous algorithm.},

When there are multiple data values per region (over time or from different datasets) shown as animated or juxtaposed cartograms, preserving the viewer's mental map in terms of stability between multiple cartograms is another important criterion alongside traditional cartogram criteria such as maintaining adjacencies. We present a method to compute stable stable Demers cartograms, where each region is shown as a square scaled proportionally to the given numerical data and similar data yield similar cartograms. We enforce orthogonal separation constraints using linear programming, and measure quality in terms of keeping adjacent regions close (cartogram quality) and using similar positions for a region between the different data values (stability). Our method guarantees the ability to connect most lost adjacencies with minimal-length planar orthogonal polylines. Experiments show that our method yields good quality and stability on multiple quality criteria.},

This work surveys cartogram research in visualization, cartography and geometry, covering a broad spectrum of different cartogram types: from the traditional rectangular and table cartograms, to Dorling and diffusion cartograms. A particular focus is the study of the major cartogram dimensions: statistical accuracy, geographical accuracy, and topological accuracy.

Despite the popularity of cartograms, and the large number of cartogram types, there are few studies evaluating the effectiveness of cartograms in conveying information. Based on a recent task taxonomy for cartograms, we evaluate four major types of cartograms: contiguous, non-contiguous, rectangular, and Dorling cartograms. We first evaluate the effectiveness of these cartogram types by quantitative performance analysis (time and error). Second, we collect qualitative data with an attitude study and by analyzing subjective preferences. Third, we compare the quantitative and qualitative results with the results of a metrics-based cartogram evaluation. Fourth, we analyze the results of our study in the context of cartography, geography, visual perception, and demography. Finally, we consider implications for design and possible improvements.},

Of the many different types of cartograms, the contiguous and Dorling types are among the most popular and most effective. With this in mind, we evaluate the memorability of these two cartogram types with a human-subjects study, using task-based experimental data and cartogram visualization tasks based on Bertin's map reading levels. In particular, our results indicate that Dorling cartograms are associated with better recall of general patterns and trends. This, together with additional significant differences between the two most popular cartogram types, has implications for the design and use of cartograms, in the context of memorability.},

However, in general, only limited information related to evacuation procedures and using a directional arrow to indicate existing shelters is provided on the evacuation map. Moreover, the evacuation routes leading to nearby shelters are not presented effectively to people in an emergency situation. This paper aimed to provide an approach to generate a flood evacuation cartogram based on an actual evacuation. The proposed time\textendash distance cartogram preserves the topological characteristics by minimizing distortion in transforming the evacuation routes. To empirically evaluate its application, we applied the proposed method to Siheung city in Korea. As a result, optimal shelter and evacuation routes were derived by considering significant factors influencing the actual access to the facilities. Moreover, the flood evacuation cartogram provides a more intuitive visualization than classic topographic maps, by relocating shelters and reshaping the routes intended for evacuation. The suggested method is significant as it provides practical flood evacuation information effectively and intuitively, and the generated cartograms as empirical results also provide helpful insights for more efficient evacuation plans.},

  abstract = {Cartogram is a technique for visualisation of the geographical distribution of spatial data. It has two main types, i.e. distance cartogram and area cartogram. Area cartogram is a transformed map in which areas are resized in proportion to an attribute value. A number of techniques have been developed for the generation of area cartograms. Some researchers consider cartogram as a very effective technique for visualisation of spatial data, while others doubt about the effectiveness because of the possible distortion in shape and/or disconnectivity in topology. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of area cartogram for visualizing spatial data. In this study, two comparative experiments have been conducted. One is the comparison between thematic maps and cartograms, and the other is the comparison among different types of area cartogram. Two sets of data with different characteristics are used, i.e. 2005 China population data and 1996 US election data. Results show that cartogram is more effective in the representation of the 1996 US election data which provides a qualitative result (i.e. in binary form or nominal data), but thematic map is far more effective in the representation of 2005 China population data which provides a quantitative result (in classes or ordinal data). It is also found that among different types of area cartogram, pseudo-cartogram is the most preferred technique and Dorling cartogram is the least preferred one.},

  abstract = {Cartograms are a popular and useful technique for depicting geo-spatial data. Dorling style and rectangular cartograms are very good for facilitating comparisons between unit areas. Each unit area is represented by the same shape such as a circle or rectangle, and the uniformity in shapes facilitates comparative judgment. However, the layout of these more abstract shapes may also simultaneously reduce the map's legibility and increase error. When we integrate univariate data into a cartogram, the recognizability of cartogram may be reduced. There is a trade-off between information recognition and geo-information accuracy. This is the inspiration behind the work we present. We attempt to increase the map's recognizability and reduce error by introducing topological features into the cartographic map. Our goal is to include topological features such as a river in a Dorling-style or rectangular cartogram to make the visual layout more recognizable, increase map cognition and reduce geo-spatial error. We believe that compared to the standard Dorling and rectangular style cartogram, adding topological features provides familiar geo-spatial cues and flexibility to enhance the recognizability of a cartogram.},
