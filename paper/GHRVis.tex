\title{Cartograms with Dynamic Features}

\begin{document}

\pagestyle{plain}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Cartograms are hybrid representations of geographical and abstract data based on a value-by-area mapping technique. Based on the Dorling cartogram, the Demers cartogram uses squares instead of circles to represent regions, enabling the comparison of regions in a more intuitive way with a higher screen space utilization. One of the disadvantages of the Dorling cartogram and its variants is that regions may be displaced from their original positions, reducing the legibility, readability, and geographical accuracy. To address that, we propose a novel layout algorithm that integrates dynamic topological features such as rivers into Demers cartograms. We evaluate the proposed layout algorithm through a user study with an application to an Electronic Health Records (EHR) dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed layout algorithm is able to preserve some of the original properties of the cartogram, while improving the legibility, readability, and geographical accuracy of the cartogram.
