\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Hypotheses Formulation}

We formulate the following hypotheses to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach:

\textbf{H1:} The introduction of dynamic topological features can effectively improve the recognizability of CCGs.

\textbf{H2:} \dots

\subsection{Participants}

We recruited X participants, [add demographics here].

\subsection{Datasets}

We used the following datasets for our evaluation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Under 75 mortality from cardiovascular disease
    \item Emergency admissions for alcohol related liver disease
\end{itemize}

Datasets are projected on a map that consists of 135 CGGs in England.

\subsection{Tasks}

We conducted tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.

\textbf{T1:} The participants were asked to familiarize with the design, including the user options and the interaction methods.
\textbf{T2:} The participants 


\subsection{Questionnaire}

We asked participants to complete a questionnaire to collect their feedback. The questionnaire consisted of the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \dots
    \item \dots
\end{itemize}
