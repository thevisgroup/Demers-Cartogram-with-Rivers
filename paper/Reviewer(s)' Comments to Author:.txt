Abstract:
"dynamic topological elements"
The adjective "dynamic" is misleading because the rivers appear static on the visualisation from the user's perspective. I am aware of the authors' remark on the term "dynamic" on page 2, but many readers will only read the abstract and, hence, draw wrong conclusions about the nature of this research.

Page 1, left column, near row number 46:
"Demers cartograms offer the advantage in cases where the data is not
directly correlated to region sizes."
It is unclear what advantage they offer.

Page 1, left column, near row number 48:
"Also, the comparison of magnitudes becomes an area estimation task, which is more effective for a numeric data encoding."
More effective than what?

Page 2, right column, section titled "Peer-reviewed Applications":
The first paragraph is purely enumerative and there are certainly many more publications that have used various types of cartograms. Hence, this paragraph lacks motivation and a clear narrative. For example, it would be better to focus exclusively on papers using Demers cartograms for applications.
The same comment applies to the first paragraph of the subsequent section section titled "Cartograms in Media".


Page 4, right column, equation near row number 60:
The definition of $\epsilon_{c_{\text{max}}}$ is unclear. How is $\max\{\mathbf{n}_i, \mathbf{n}_{i_t}\}$ in the denominator to be interpreted? Both $\mathbf{n}_i$ and $\mathbf{n}_{i_t}$ are two-dimensional vectors, so it is unclear whether the maximum is to be applied to the first or the second dimension. In fact, it is unclear why that maximum would even be relevant in this context because an arbitrary translation of the origin would change the value of $\epsilon_{c_{\text{max}}}$ without causing any visual difference.

"a standard choropleth on the left side of the screen and the equivalent cartogram on the right side"
Choropleth maps and cartograms should never be viewed as equivalent. Color is to be used as visual variable for standardized data only (e.g., GDP per capita), whereas area is to be used as visual variable of non-standardized data only (e.g., raw GDP, not divided by population). See for example T. Slocum et al., Thematic Cartography and Geovisualization (3rd ed.), Prentice Hall (2009), page 6:
"Presuming that the student had collected data in raw total form, the choropleth map would be a poor choice because it requires standardized data."
A presumed equivalence of choropleth maps and cartograms has often erroneously been claimed in the literature, and it is time to adopt a more informed approach. Thus, a sentence needs to be added that color is not used in this experiment to create a choropleth map; instead color is used to facilitate comparison between a conventional map and a cartogram. In this regard, the experiment resembles I. K. Duncan et al. (2021) IEEE TVCG, 27(3):2136-2152, doi: 10.1109/TVCG.2020.3041745 and K. L. T. Fung et al. (2023) IEEE TVCG, doi: 10.1109/TVCG.2023.3275925.
