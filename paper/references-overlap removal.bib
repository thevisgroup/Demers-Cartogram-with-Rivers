  abstract = {Motivated by visualizing spatial data using proportional symbols, we study the following problem: given a set of overlapping squares of varying sizes, minimally displace the squares as to remove the overlap while maintaining the orthogonal order on their centers. Though this problem is NP-hard, we show that rotating the squares by 45 degrees into diamonds allows for a linear or convex quadratic program. It is thus efficiently solvable even for relatively large instances.},

  abstract = {When representing 2D data points with spacious objects such as labels, overlap can occur. We present a simple algorithm which modifies the (Mani-)Wordle idea with scan-line based techniques to allow a better placement. We give an introduction to common placement techniques from different fields and compare our method to these techniques w.r.t. euclidean displacement, changes in orthogonal ordering as well as shape and size preservation. Especially in dense scenarios our method preserves the overall shape better than known techniques and allows a good trade-off between the other measures. Applications on real world data are given and discussed.},
